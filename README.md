# phone-book-python-group-work
This project was a group work for our Data Structures and Algorithm class.
We were tasked to build a phone book app using a data structure .
we settled on using dictionaries becuase they store and map unique keys( contact name) to values (numbers)
The limitation in this group work was that dictionaries cannot stores duplicates.
Contacts with the same key( Contact Name) had their values (numbers)  overidden 

I would love to turn the code into Javascript with a responsive user interface
